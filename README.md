# PECS 4 Move Platform Back-end

This repository contains the backend API for Prisoner Escort and
Custody Services 4.

## Ruby versions and other dependencies

* Ruby version
    * Ruby version 2.6
    * Rails 5.2

* System dependencies
    * postgres
    * redis

## Development Environment setup

To setup the local development environment:

1. Install Postgres and Redis if needed.
2. Clone this Git repository.
3. Run `bin/setup` to install Rubygem dependencies, then setup local
   test and development databases etc.

### Running the application

After setup should then be able to run the local Web server:

```bash
bundle exec rails server
```

### Creating client credentials

The application implements OAuth2 client credentials flow. To generate new application client credentials, use the following Rake task:

```bash
bundle exec rake auth:create_client_application NAME=test
```

Please note; the automatically generated secret is hashed and cannot be retrieved later.

To get an access token with client credentials flow, do a POST request to the `/oauth/token` endpoint:

```
POST /oauth/token
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8
grant_type=client_credentials
```

The Authorization header includes the encoded credentials for the client, represented as a Base64-encoded (without line breaks) string of the form `<client_id>:<client_secret>`.

You will receive a JSON payload containing an `access_token` and `expires_in`. You can then sign following requests with the following header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The `expires_in` response denotes the time in seconds from the token request after which the token will expire.

### Running tests

We use RSpec for testing, to run the tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec
```

We use Rubocop for code linting, to run the checks:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

### Create fake data

To create fake data to use for testing and in a development environment run:

```
bundle exec rails fake_data:recreate_all
```

**WARNING:** This will delete all existing data

### Create reference data

To create reference data (seed data) needed in production run the
following rake tasks:

```bash
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_locations
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_ethnicities
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_genders
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_identifier_types
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_assessment_questions
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_allocation_complex_cases
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_nomis_alerts
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_regions
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_suppliers
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_prison_transfer_reasons
bundle exec rake reference_data:link_suppliers
bundle exec rake reference_data:link_suppliers
```

Alternatively, **all** of the reference data can be created at once by running the combined rake task:

```bash
bundle exec rake reference_data:create_all
```

Some of these tasks pull data from NOMIS and therefore require
environment variables configured with the relevant security credentials.

These tasks are designed to be non-destructive. They can be run multiple
times and will only modify data if the original data source has changed.

## Documentation
### Database schema
A database schema diagram can be generated by running:

```bash
bundle exec rake erd
```

This will output a file named `erd.pdf`; this file should not be added to git as it can be generated on demand.

Graphviz also needs to be installed (`brew install graphviz`) for this to work. For more details see: https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd

## Continuous Integration

We use Circle CI for continuous integration: running tests, updating the
Docker image, pushing code staging:

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ministryofjustice/hmpps-book-secure-move-api)](https://circleci.com/gh/ministryofjustice/hmpps-book-secure-move-api)

## Deployment

This application is deployed to [Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/).

Currently we have a `staging` and `production` environment on Cloud
Platform with the following namespace names:

* hmpps-book-secure-move-api-staging
* hmpps-book-secure-move-api-production

`staging` that is automatically deployed on successful builds of the
`master` branch on Circle CI.

`production` can be deployed on any successful build of `master` but
requires manual intervention to approve the `hold_production` step in
the workflow. To approve a particular deploy for build log into
CircleCI, find the build that you want to deploy and click the
`test-build-deploy` link. This should take you to the workflow graph for
that build where you can click the `hold_production` step to kick off
the production deploy.
