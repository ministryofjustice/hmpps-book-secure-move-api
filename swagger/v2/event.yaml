            Events have many forms which determine their accepted payload shape and validations. The event_type indicates which form the payload, validations and any relevant event actions take.

            An invalid (non-existing) event_type field triggers a validation error.

            See our [wiki](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-book-secure-move-api/wiki/Event-Documentation) for specific event validations/expected json payloads and lengthy descriptions.

            This is **mandatory** and specific to each event.

            Please always include the zone to be most accurate (e.g. '2020-06-16T10:20:30+01:00').

            The username of the user who either triggered the event or performed an action in the UI which resulted in an event being triggered.

            When the event is triggered by a supplier, this will return the supplier name. Otherwise it will return the username of the user who performed the relevant action in the UI.
