    Accepted response content type.

    We currently support `application/vnd.api+json` and `version` 1 and 2.

    Additionally, the `GET /moves` endpoint only supports content type of `application/csv` or `text/csv`; this will return a CSV file rather than JSONAPI. When specifying a CSV content type pagination parameters are ignored and all relevant records are returned.

    You don't have to supply the media type. `version` _must_ be provided.
